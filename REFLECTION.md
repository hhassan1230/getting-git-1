One thing that surprised me about whatâ€™s inside the .git folder was that the .git folder is a hidden folder by default, and it hides quite a few files and folders, it looks like log and backup something. That is a quite mysterious. 
I'm interested about the git rebase command, moves your branch to a new base commit. It's really abstract.
